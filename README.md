# NovaCoreForMiniblox

NovaCore is a lightweight, modular Tampermonkey userscript (JavaScript) framework for Miniblox.  
This repository contains improvements, quality-of-life enhancements, and new features built on top of the original NovaCore V1 by @Scripter132132. The goal is to provide a modular, easy-to-configure userscript that scripters can extend and reuse.

## TL;DR
- Type: Tampermonkey userscript (using JavaScript)
- Purpose: Clean, modular foundation for Miniblox scripting!
- Credit: Original V1 by @Scripter132132 — extended and maintained by @TheM1ddleM1n

## Requirements
- Browser with a userscript manager (Tampermonkey is recommended).
- Miniblox (or the target site/environment the script is designed to modify).

## Installation (FOR TAMPERMONKEY)
1. Install Tampermonkey (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Opera) — https://www.tampermonkey.net/
2. Install the script:
   - Option A: Open Tampermonkey dashboard → Add new script → copy/paste the script contents → Save.
3. Configure the script (see Configuration below) then enable it in the Tampermonkey dashboard.

Userscript header (example)
Make sure the actual script contains an appropriate metadata block. An example:
```js
// ==UserScript==
// @name         NovaCore V2 Enhanced
// @namespace    vector fr fr
// @version      2.1
// @description  NovaCore V2 but improved!
// @author       (Cant reveal who im), TheM1ddleM1n
// @match        https://miniblox.io/
// @grant        none
// ==/UserScript==
```

## Usage
- Install the userscript in Tampermonkey and visit the target site which is Miniblox.io (see @match).
- Open the Tampermonkey dashboard to edit configuration or to enable/disable the script.
